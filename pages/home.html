	SeVoAuth is a secure and privacy-preserving voiceprint authentication system with sound usability. It uses voiceprint synthesis to protect users' voiceprint privacy, and applies a hash chain to update authentication target voiceprint to successfully resist against replay attacks, spoofing attacks and adversarial attacks. We conducted a series of user tests based on a prototype system to verify the effectiveness of SeVoAuth. The test results show that SeVoAuth is accurate, efficient, secure, robust and highly usable. Compared with other existing cutting-edge works, SeVoAuth performs the best in general.
    <p class="text_column"><b>User test</b><br/>
	The user test will take about 20 minutes. We need you to fill in a series of forms and questionnaires, and follow the prompts in the system for the corresponding operation. After you read and agree to our privacy statement, you can start user testing and research. </p>
